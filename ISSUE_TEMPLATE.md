Here is a template you can use for reporting bugs. It is just a suggestion - some items might not be relevant to your issue.

- [a description of the issue]
- [pictures of the issue (if applicable)]
- The bug occurs just after [text from when bug occurs] is shown on the screen
- My operating system is [Windows, MacOS, Linux]
- I installed the game [X Months ago]
- I am running the [Full Patch / Voice only patch]
- I installed the game [Manually / using the Automatic Installer]
- My computer is a [Gaming Beast / Laptop with Integrated Graphics]
- Add the `stderr.txt` and `stdout.txt` to the post, as described above.

For issues where the game crashes or behaves badly, it is extremely useful to get the game's error log. Newer auto-installations can simply double click the "Umineko1to4_DebugMode.bat" file to start the game in debug mode.

Once you have started the game in debug mode, just play until the game crashes or behaves badly, then submit the `stderr.txt` and `stdout.txt` to us (when game is started in debug mode, a folder will appear showing `stderr.txt` and `stdout.txt`).

If you're not sure if it's a bug, you can report it on our discord (but try not to post any spoilers, if possible).
We really appreciate your help!
