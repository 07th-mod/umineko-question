# Umineko no Naku Koro ni (Question Arcs) - PS3 Voice and graphics patch

This patch aims to modify the newest release of Umineko by MangaGamer, making it a complete conversion based on the PS3 release.
It is compatible with the Steam version ***and*** the MangaGamer DRM-free download.

The patch is now available to download, but many features are missing, bugs are everywhere and some unexpected stuff might happen. We do not recommend to use this patch on a serious playthrough.


## Features

Currently the game has over 90% of voices implemented. PS3 graphics are not yet available.
