# Umineko no Naku Koro ni (Question Arcs) - PS3 Voice and graphics patch

This patch aims to modify the newest release of Umineko by MangaGamer, changing its assets to replicate the PS3 version of the game.
It is compatible with the Steam version ***and*** the MangaGamer DRM-free download.

The patch is currently playable, but some features are still missing. Check [Umineko Project](https://umineko-project.org/en/) if you want to play a complete conversion of the game.
